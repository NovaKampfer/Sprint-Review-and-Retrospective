#Throughout the SNHU Travel project, I learned how to interpret user needs by breaking them down into user stories, which helped clarify expectations and guide development. Writing user stories made it easier to plan and implement features that truly met stakeholder goals. My approach to developing programs has #improved by working through Agile practices like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Retrospectives. I now see how valuable it is to work iteratively, prioritize flexibility, and welcome changing requirements. In future projects, I plan to continue using these Agile processes to stay adaptable and focused. I #also learned that being a good team member means more than just completing your tasks—it involves communicating clearly, collaborating across roles, and supporting the team’s progress. Agile reinforced the idea that shared responsibility and regular feedback lead to better outcomes and a stronger product.
